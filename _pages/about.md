I'm Brindha Sivakumar, a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Michigan-Dearborn with 7 years of professional experience in cybersecurity and infrastructure security.

## What I Do

I specialize in the intersection of AI and security, focusing on:
- **Explainable AI** - Making security AI transparent and trustworthy
- **Adversarial AI** - Understanding and defending against attacks on ML systems
- **Security Automation** - Kubernetes security policies, SOC playbooks, and DevSecOps

## Current Focus

I'm pursuing applied research on Explainable AI and Causal Inference for Intelligent Network Intrusion Detection Systems, working to improve alert prioritization and reduce false positives in security operations.

## Background

My journey combines deep technical expertise in security operations (SIEM, SOAR, UEBA) with modern AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn). I've worked at companies like Workday, Smarttech247, and Tata Consultancy Services, where I've built security solutions at scale.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking summer 2025 internship opportunities in AI, cybersecurity, or the exciting intersection of both fields where I can apply my unique blend of skills to solve real-world security challenges.
