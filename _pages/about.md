Graduate student in Artificial Intelligence with **7 years of professional experience** in cybersecurity and infrastructure security. Specializes in implementing robust security measures, automating workflows, and applying AI/ML techniques to solve complex security challenges. Currently pursuing applied research on AI threat landscape with a focus on securing the AI lifecycle, focusing on adversarial robustness against model extraction and training data poisoning within cloud-native infrastructures.

**Unique Value Proposition:** Bridges the gap between AI innovation and cybersecurity operations, bringing both deep technical expertise and practical industry experience to build secure, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems.

## Current Focus

I'm pursuing applied research on AI threat landscape with a focus on securing the AI lifecycle, focusing on adversarial robustness against model extraction and training data poisoning within cloud-native infrastructures.

## Background

My journey combines deep technical expertise in security operations (SIEM, SOAR, UEBA) with modern AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn). I've worked at companies like Workday, Smarttech247, and Tata Consultancy Services, where I've built security solutions at scale.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking summer 2025 internship opportunities in AI, cybersecurity, or the exciting intersection of both fields where I can apply my unique blend of skills to solve real-world security challenges.
