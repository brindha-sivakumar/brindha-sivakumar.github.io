## AI Focus Area
Machine Learning for Cybersecurity | Explainable AI | Causal Inference

## Overview
Developed a novel hybrid framework integrating Explainable AI techniques with Causal Inference to improve the interpretability and effectiveness of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). This research-oriented project aims to solve the "black box" problem in AI-powered security systems by providing transparency to security analysts with root cause analysis.

## Technical Implementation
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifier for alert classification (important vs irrelevant)
- DeepLIFT XAI framework selected after evaluating four XAI techniques (DeepLIFT, LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) across various metrics 
- Applied Peter-Clark (PC) and Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithms to construct a consensus causal graph that identifies root causes and causal paths.
- Combined to develop a hybrid framework that synthesized XAI feature importance with causal graph traversal to generate actionable explanations.


## Key Achievements
- Achieved 36% causal coverage demonstrating meaningful XAI-causal integration for alert prioritization
- Demonstrated 70% complementarity between XAI and causal approaches, proving they analyze different but complementary aspects of network threats
- Validated framework across two datasets (TalTech NIDS, UNSW-NB15), confirming robustness and generalizability
